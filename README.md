# Overweight Prediction Model

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to predict weight status (e.g., Overweight, Normal Weight) based on various health-related features. The model uses a Random Forest Classifier and is trained on a dataset containing individual health metrics.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher). You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Place your dataset in the appropriate directory.

3. Run the model training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. To make predictions, modify the `predict.py` script with your input data and run:
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

## Data
The dataset used for training is in CSV format and contains the following features:
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Gender
- Family history of overweight
- And more...

## Model Training
The model is trained using the following steps:
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical features).
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training the Random Forest Classifier.
- Hyperparameter tuning using Randomized Search Cross Validation.

## Evaluation
The model's accuracy is evaluated using cross-validation. The best performing model achieved an accuracy of approximately **98.67%** on the test set.
